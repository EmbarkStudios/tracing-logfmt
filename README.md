## Logfmt

Logfmt is a compact and simple log format for structured logging. Each log row contains one level of key/value pairs. To keep it as compact and readable as possible, values are only quoted if needed.

```logfmt
key=value otherkey="value with spaces" third="with escaped \"chars\""
```

There is no strict standard for the format, but it was first documented in [this article](https://brandur.org/logfmt) by Brandur Leach.
